The Department of Atmospheric Sciences has the following platforms available for research projects:

**[System for Characterizing and Measuring Precipitation (SCAMP)](https://atmos.illinois.edu/research/research-equipment/scamp)**

This system includes

- Radiometrics deployable 915 MHz wind profiling radar
- MRR-2 K-Band vertically pointing radar
- Parsivel-2 disdrometer
- 2 iMet radiosonde systems
- Meteorological Particle Spectrometer
- Geonor weighing rain gauge
- Surface weather station
- TSI Aerosol spectrometer

The Illinois State Water Survey (affiliate Faculty in the department) also operates:

- Raman lidar
- Scanning Doppler lidar

**[Flexible Arrays of Radars and Mesonets (FARM) Facility](https://farm.atmos.illinois.edu)**

In 2020, the FARM Facility joined the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Illinois.  This facility operates

National Science Foundation Community Instrument Facility:
- 3 mobile X-Band Doppler radars, 2 dual-polarization, 1 rapid scan (DOW6, DOW7, DOW8), 
- 1 deployable C-Band dual-polarization radar (COW)

The FARM also operates:
- 3 mobile mesonet trucks
- 6 Graw sounding systems
- PODs and PoleNet surface observing systems, with Parsivel disdrometers and cameras
