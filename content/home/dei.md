I believe that Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion is a key scientific ethics issue of the early 21st Century.  My research group values a commitment to respect.  As we face the challenge of making geosciences more welcoming and accessible to all groups, I have undertaken the following actions to add to a more inclusive community of scientists:

- Polaris Academy in Chicago (2009): Taught lectures at the Polaris Academy on the West Side of Chicago, and brought ~75 students to the Urbana Campus to receive a full day of hands-on weather lectures and tour of campus.

- Jemez Mountain Experiment (JEMEX, 2012): Led a field campaign where 5 students from diverse racial and socioeconomic backgrounds from Fort Lewis College, Durango, CO deployed, collected, and analyzed rain gauge data collected near the south-facing slopes of the Jemez Caldera, New Mexico.

- RELAMPAGO field campaign: I was the lead principal investigator of a field campaign of over 190 scientists from 4 continents (forthcoming article by Nesbitt et al. 2021, Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society).  I assembled a large cohort of diverse and early career principal investigators into the project.  During this project we established a [formal harassment policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16gmv_48yAqXzruhaBu5XsB4h1CLb14rnx2nsDDMRKrY/edit?usp=sharing), enabled participant anti-bias and harassment training, collected data on harassment experiences (forthcoming article by Fischer et al. 2021, Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society), collaborated in an National Science Foundation Advanced Study Institute, which brought 12 graduate students from diverse backgrounds to the field campaign (forthcoming article by Rasmussen et al. 2021, Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society), and co-led education and outreach and an open house which impacted thousands of students in Argentina.

- I currently serve as the Chair of the Department of Atmospheric Sciences Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee, am the Department's Diversity Advocate, and serve on the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Diversity Working Group.  The DEI committee has drafted a strategic plan and has identified 16 short term and 9 long term action items, including making the faculty more accountable for information and progress on DEI-related issues.  As part of these efforts, the GRE Exam was removed from consideration in graduate applications, a diversity statement was added to the Department [web site](https://atmos.illinois.edu/resources/diversity-commitment), information on how to obtain fee-waivers is now widely available, graduate and undergraduate curricula in DEI-related issues was enhanced, and other actions including plans for other department climate-related initiatives are underway.
